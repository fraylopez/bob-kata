> The scientist asks Bob to practice with the Roamers to get used to them.

- [ ] Bob can move a Roamer to a given Position (x,y,z)
- [ ] Bob can order a Roamer to perform a `PuzzleCommand`.
- [ ] Since it is the first time Bob uses a Roamer, the Command has a `successRate` of 20% and a `completionTime` of 1 minute.
- [ ] Once a Command succeeds, Bob can order a Roamer to perform a `PuzzleCommand` with a `successRate` of 100% and a `completionTime` of 50% of the original time.
