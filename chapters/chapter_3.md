### Chapter 3

> June 25, 2133

> The scientist explains to Bob that he has no body, but that he can interact with the world through a computer interface that controls small atonomous IA robots called "ROAMers" (Remote Observation And Manipulation devices).

- [ ] Bob can move a `Roamer` to a given `Position`
- [ ] Bob can order a Roamer to perform a `Command`
- [ ] A Command takes `completionTime` to be completed. Bob can `wait` for a Roamer to finish a Command. If Bob `wait`s for a time greater than `completionTime`, the Command is completed but Bob can't do anything else until the Roamer finishes the Command.
- [ ] A Command can fail to be completed. The Command has a `successRate` that determines the probability of success in percentage and a `failureTime`, as a percentage of `completionTime` that determines the time it takes to fail
