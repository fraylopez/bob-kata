### Chapter 5

> June 26, 2133
> The scientist tells Bob that he can perceive the world through the Roamers and that he can learn from the information they gather.

- [ ] A Roamer can sense the world around it and store in an internal memory as Events.
- [ ] Bob can sense what a Roamer senses, meaning he can pull Events from the Roamer's and process them as if they were his own
- [ ] Bob can only command one Roamer at a time. In other words, Bob is single threaded. He can do concurrent actions but no parallel actions.

> The scientist gives Bob access to digital information about the world and the current state of technology.

- [ ] Bob can also `LearnCommand` from any information source he has access to, since information is a bunch of `Events` put together
- [ ] Bob can learn potentially any information, but `successRate` and `completionTime` are determined by the complexity of the information and the amount of information he already knows. You or he "Game master" can determine the `successRate` and `completionTime` of any Command
- [ ] Bob can build a `LanguageTranslator`, with a `successRate` of 100% and a `completionTime` of 1 minute.
- [ ] Bob can build a `MidDifficultyProject`, with a `successRate` of 80% and a `completionTime` of 1 + Rand(1) month.
- [ ] Bob can build a `GreatDifficultyProject`, with a `successRate` of 80% and a `completionTime` of 10 + Rand(10) year.
- [ ] Bob can discover a `DiscoveryProject`, with a `successRate` of 80% and a `completionTime` of 10 + Rand(10) year.
