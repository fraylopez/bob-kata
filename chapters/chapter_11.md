### Chapter 11

> August 2144, Epsilon Eridani

> 2 misiles are detected in the vicinity of the Ship and advancing at high speed. Bob has to decide what to do. ETA 5 minutes.

==NOTE--DEV: Start a 5 dev-time minutes timer to complete and successfully execute one of the following tasks or be doomed==

- [ ] Do an `EvasiveManeuver` with a `successRate` of 50% and a `completionTime` of 0. The Ship will try to dodge the missiles so there's only one chance to succeed.

OR

- [ ] Do a `CounterAttack` with a `successRate` of 75% and a `completionTime` of 1 minute. This strategy will use a Roamer to intercept the incoming missiles.
