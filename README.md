# Bob kata

\*Based on the Bobiverse book series by Dennis E. Taylor

## Introduction

This kata brings the concept of lit-kata.
A lit-kata is a kata that tells a story. In this case, the story of Bob.

This is a Domain Modeling kata, so you should focus on the domain and the interactions between the different entities.

The kata is divided into several chapters, each one building on top of the previous one. It is recommended to do them in order.

It is also recommended to be done in a TDD fashion, so you should write tests for each step before implementing it.
